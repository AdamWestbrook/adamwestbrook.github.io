# Biography

I am an independent video artist, currently based in London.

I weave words and pictures together to make visual stories, sometimes just for fun and sometimes in collaboration with other people.

A lot of my work involves taking complex ideas and constructing a narrative that uses the principles of film form to tell a fascinating, emotional and visual story.

I love experimenting with the potential of visual storytelling, whether by [telling a story backwards](https://vimeo.com/105681474), creating a [fictional narrator](/parallax) or pushing the boundaries of [metaphor and semiotics](https://vimeo.com/157044515).

Between 2013-2016 I made short video essays which have been watched millions of times and named an official nominee in the 2015 Webby Awards.

In the past I've written, directed or edited films for The New York Times, Shopify and HuffPost UK.
