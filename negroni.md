# Negroni With A Twist
## A graphic short story (2020)

_Negroni With A Twist_ is a four-page graphic short story I wrote and drew in September and October of 2020. It was an entry into the Cape Graphic Short Story Prize.

It's a bleak little tale but a reflection, in its own way, of the year that was 2020. You can read more about its origins [here](https://adamwestbrook.substack.com/p/92-another-story-about-the-universe).
