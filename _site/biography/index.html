<p>I am an independent video artist, currently based in London.</p>

<p>I weave words and pictures together to make visual stories, sometimes just for fun and sometimes in collaboration with other people.</p>

<p>A lot of my work involves taking complex ideas and constructing a narrative that uses the principles of film form to tell a fascinating, emotional and visual story.</p>

<p>I love experimenting with the potential of visual storytelling, whether by <a href="https://vimeo.com/105681474">telling a story backwards</a>, creating a <a href="/parallax">fictional narrator</a> or pushing the boundaries of <a href="https://vimeo.com/157044515">metaphor and semiotics</a>.</p>

<p>Between 2013-2016 I made short video essays which have been watched millions of times and named an official nominee in the 2015 Webby Awards.</p>

<p>In the past Iâ€™ve written, directed or edited films for The New York Times, Shopify and HuffPost UK.</p>
