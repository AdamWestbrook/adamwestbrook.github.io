### Lost, by David Wagoner (1999)

Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you <br>are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here, <br>And you must treat it as a powerful stranger, <br>Must ask permission to know it and to be known. <br>The forest breathes. Listen. It answers, <br>I have made this place around you. <br>If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here. <br>No two trees are the same to the Raven. <br>No two branches are the same to the Wren.<br>If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,<br>You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows<br>Where you are. You must let it find you.
