![One phone call two stories, Adam Westbrook](/images/two-phone-calls.jpg)

A super quick exercise this morning to play around with gesture and story.

The rules: a short phone call, of which we only hear half the conversation; the character's gesture and/or facial expressions are used to tell us what the call is about.

Each time you tell the story, you must use the same dialogue and see how a different sequence of gestures and expressions give the conversation a completely different meaning.
