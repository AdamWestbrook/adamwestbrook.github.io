title: Flipping failure and rejection on their head

No-one wants to fail and we're all afraid of rejection. 

I have designed my whole career largely around the idea of avoiding rejection (by never putting myself forward for anything in the first place). 

A couple of perspectives have changed my thinking on this quite radically, and I thought I'd share them.

Firstly, this powerful quote from [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org):

> "It's impossible to fail if your only goal was to see what happens."

It's a simple mental reframing of a challenge but insulates you from the emotional impact of a failure.

And then there's this from editor [Vivian Lee](https://twitter.com/vivianwmlee).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I turned 30 last year, my goal was to be rejected 20 times (for my essays, fellowships, panels, etc) as a way to just, put myself out there. So far, I&#39;ve had 2 rejections but 9 pieces published, taught two courses, and spoke at 5 conferences.</p>&mdash; Vivian Lee (@vivianwmlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/vivianwmlee/status/1029010647223357440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2018</a></blockquote>

A very powerful way to flip a fear of rejection into something that encourages you forward rather than holding you back.

It's already convinced me to submit my series [*Parallax*](/parallax) to two festivals, and track the rejections as they come in.
