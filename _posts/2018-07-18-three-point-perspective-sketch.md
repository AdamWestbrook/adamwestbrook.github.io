![Three point perspective sketch, bedroom](/images/perspective-bedroom.jpg)

Here's the finished piece from [yesterday](http://www.adamwestbrook.co.uk/2018/07/17/three-point-perspective-progress.html), inked and coloured.

It's another Scott McCloud exercise. The aim is to draw an empty room and put in enough telling details from the environment that a reader could picture the person living there.

I had a lot more details I wanted to include in my initial sketch but chose to keep it clean in the end. 

I'm really happy with my rendering of the perspective - for a first attempt, but the colouring is off...I need to work on my shading!
