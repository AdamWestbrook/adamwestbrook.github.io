# What does success look like to you?
## A library and a swimming pool
##### London, April 2018

"What does success look like to you?" my friend [Guy](https://twitter.com/guygunaratne) asked me.

We were in a London bookshop, keeping an eye out for copies of his new novel.

I had to think about it for a moment, but just a moment.

"A library" I said, "- oh, and a swimming pool."

When it comes to quantifying success, I've gone through the full spectrum, like anyone has.

There was definitely a time in my youth when I wanted Fame; by my late twenties that had softened into just Recognition. 

Then success was Independence. The ability to create free from market influence, with my own passionate - if small - audience.

I have flirted briefly with material success, but Money has never been a huge motivator.

And more recently there has been a time where I have defining potential success in an absence of all of these things like a kind of creative Benedictine Monk.

All things considered, now I want a library.

Not a physical library though. 

"You should think of the internet as an archive."

This is Guy again, six months earlier, when a piece of work I had made had failed bring either Fame, Recognition, Independence or Money.

He said everything we make and publish stays there forever - unless we ourselves remove it (or, I imagine, there is some kind of Zero Day disaster when all our information, stupidly centralised on just a few private servers, is wiped--a thought for another day).

Making and publishing online is so often about the loud launch: making a big noise the moment you publish, getting immediate attention; what Seth Godin describes as [the Grand Opening](https://www.akimbo.me/blog/episode-1-the-grand-opening). 

But what it really is, is a slow, quiet and steady accumulation of work over a long period of time: the building of an archive, *a library*.

And that for me is success in the Long Game. To be able to look back on my life's work and see a *quantity* of completed work. 

The work doesn't have to have been successful, popular, or even that good. But it's done. It's complete.

I can't help but admire those prolific artists:  Vincent Van Gogh (860), Isaac Asimov (500) The Grateful Dead (144), Stephen King (98), even if I don't necessarily dig their work.

What I admire about it is this: it is workmanlike. To be so prolific shows someone who treats art, not as some kind of mercurial inspiration that comes and goes when it pleases; but as a craft. Writing a novel, or painting oils, making a film: it's like being a cobbler. You go to work, and you make the next damn shoe. 

And to build a library, you need the other factor: time. It shows a commitment of decades to making art, a commitment to [The Long Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLctgPm-taRR-YjbpuKuFW9i0pfMiuir1u).

So yeah, that's what success looks like to me at the end of all this.

Oh, and the swimming pool? Alright, that one's just for fun.
