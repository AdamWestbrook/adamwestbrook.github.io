In his hallmark book [*Understand Comics*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530547174&sr=8-1&keywords=understanding+comics), [Scott McCloud](https://twitter.com/scottmccloud) breaks down the key mechanics of sequential art as they pertain to comic books and graphic novels.

At one point he lists six different panel-to-panel transitions available to the comic artist to move through a story.

1. Moment-to-moment
2. Action-to-action
3. Subject-to-subject
4. Scene-to-scene
5. Aspect-to-aspect
6. Non-Sequitur

These transitions could just as easily be shot-to-shot transitions in film and video. 

I experimented with this idea, using three of McCloud's panel-to-panel transitions on a single story.

I took the classic story: **The queen died, and the king died of grief** and tried to tell it using only one kind of transition each time.

### Scene-to-scene transitions (below, left)

The idea here is that each panel moves us to a new scene, which implies a new action in each panel. 

What's really interesting is that for us to move to a new scene with each panel, it requires a leap in **time** - it literally takes time for a character to move from one room to another.

The only exception I can think to of this, would be to show a simultaneous moment in time from multiple perspectives.

As more time has passed and more action has happened between panels, it requires more involvement from the viewer/reader to follow the story.

I enjoyed this format, but my images do not have enough clarity - the opening panel does not scream "the queen has died". That said, the story kind of works retroactively: by having the final panel match the first, it forces the reader to go back and tell the story to themselves again. I like that.

### Aspect-to-aspect transitions (above, right)

Compare the temporal dimension of scene-to-scene transitions with this next arrangement of the story.

It became clear through doing the exercise that this transition is about **freezing time**. 

Very popular in Japanese manga, the aspect-to-aspect transition is about creating a sense of mood or place. You take a fraction of a second and show it from different perspectives.

So in order to tell this story successfully I had to pick the right single moment - and there could be no action. So I chose the moment of death of the king and tried to use the different angles to reveal his motivations.

It's fine - I like the rain on the window and the snuffing out candle as a way of visualising the moment of death...but the blood dripping on the dropped photograph is cringe-worthy in its cliché.

### Moment-to-moment transitions (below)

Although McCloud separates moment-to-moment transitions and aspect-to-aspect transitions in his list (1 and 5 respectively), they are - in terms of time management - very similar. 

They both force the artist to choose a single moment for the telling of their story.

The difference, it seems is that in this transition type, some action actually takes place.

Here, I had to think about the best single action that could tell the whole story. My idea is still cliché, but I do like the way the queen's death is revealed only in the final panel as the king slumps to the floor.
