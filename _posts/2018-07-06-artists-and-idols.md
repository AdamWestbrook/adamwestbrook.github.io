There's a page in Austin Kleon's *Steal Like an Artist Journal* that I can't get around to filling out.

And also this one.

In all honesty, I can't think of anyone who deserves the word *idol*.

There are people who I admire professionally and others who I am inspired by. 

But idols? That's a strong word. It suggests an obsession over a person, elevating them to a place above the rest of us. 

### The first problem with idols

Someone (was it Steven Pressfield? Derek Sivers? Elizabeth Gilbert? I can't find the original quote) once had something smart to say about this.

They said that when we make someone an idol, we surrender our power to them. We take the creative energy we have inside us - meant for us to use ourselves - and transfer it to someone we think deserves it more.

Ah - hang on, it must have been Steven Pressfield. [Here he is, describing idolising another person as a form of self-sabotage - of resistance](https://stevenpressfield.com/2010/07/icons-and-iconization/):

>> When we make a human being into an icon, we endow them in our imagination with a power or gift that we in fact possess ourselves, but are either afraid, or not yet ready to, embrace...Making others into icons is a form of Resistance. We endow others with powers because weâ€™re afraid to claim those powers for ourselves.

I think that when I read that, many years ago, I stopped projecting my energy onto other people.

### The second problem with idols

These days, idolising someone famous or successful is a risky business.

Maybe the last person I thought was the bees-knees was ol' Hitchcock, but then I read [about Tippi Hedren](https://variety.com/2017/film/news/tippi-hedren-alfred-hitchcock-the-birds-sexual-harassment-1202637959/) and I didn't feel like keeping him on a pedestal any longer.

### But what about role models?

Role models is a more interesting one. It feels less like surrendering your power to someone else and more like seeking others to learn from.

**A topic of discussion for a future blog post**: the difficulty of finding good role models as you get older. Our culture is fast to present us with amazing young achievers but once you're in your thirties, you need to look further...ahead. 

And it feels to me like there are fewer role models in the middle-aged bracket - especially for men. 

Anyway, that's a discussion for another time!
