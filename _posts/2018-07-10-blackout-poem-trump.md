Still working my way through [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com)'s Journal (a little bit every day, just to ease in the creative muscles). 

He's known for his *Blackout Poetry*, poems created by blacking out large parts of another work - the page of a book, an article - and using the remains to make something new.

His journal contains a photocopied spread from Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* (pages 612-613) and an invitation to create a Blackout Poem.

What I didn't expect to find was a poem about Trump and the Mueller Investigation...

>>**The Chase**<br>This pursuit of invincible confidence,<br>some great progression of desires<br>in the mind of the hunter.<br><br>The speed of the wind and the sea,<br>a cannon-ball motion.<br><br>Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!<br>The mad fiend Trump,<br>his water-gate forebodings.
