>> "Yes, you must feel when you write, free. You must disentangle all oughts. You must disconnect all shackles, weights, obligations, all duties. You can write as badly as you want to. You can write *anything* you want to -- a six act blank verse, symbolic tragedy, or a vulgar short, short story. Just so that you write it with honesty and gusto, and do not try to make somebody believe you are smarter than you are."
