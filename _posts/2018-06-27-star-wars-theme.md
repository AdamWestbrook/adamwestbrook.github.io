title: Developments on a Star Wars theme

I saw *Solo: A Star Wars Story* earlier this week, the latest in the Disney-owned franchise which appears to have, at best, divided fans.

I quite liked it myself and something I have really enjoyed is the score.

John Williams' original score, with it's many recognisable leitmotifs, is, for me, a character in itself in the Star Wars universe. (You can say the same for Ben Burtt's sound design too). 

And one of the unexpected pleasures of Disney's anthology films is they have invited other composers to make variations on Williams' original themes.

I think Michael Giacchino (*Rogue One*) and John Powell (*Solo*) have done a great job in taking some of the smaller, but recognisable, themes from the original scores and building them out. 

New riffs, on familiar ideas.

Take just three tracks from the *Solo* album which all offer something new, while incorporating music from the universe we recognise.
