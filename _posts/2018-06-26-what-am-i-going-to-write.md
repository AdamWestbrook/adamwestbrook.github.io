title: What am I going to write about today? On being creatively present. 
date: 2018-06-26

On publishing my first new blog post yesterday - a feat that has taken about a week of preparation - my first thought this morning was: "*I have no idea what I am going to write about today*".

At first, a feeling of fear: "*what am I going to write?!*"; then admonishment: "*why didn't I plan something in advance?*"

But then I remembered that this was the entire point of the exercise. 

I had no idea what I was going to create when I woke up this morning, and I will have no idea what tomorrow's output will look like when I wake up then. But something will happen.

This is liberating.

It forces me to be open about what experiences the day may bring; it forces me to be observant for potential inspiration; it forces me to embrace spontaneity; above all, **it forces me to be present**.

I want this blog to be part of a practice of being creatively present: a practice of treating creativity like an act of the living and not a pre-planned result of industry. 

So that's the rule: each morning as I rise, I should have no idea what the creative output of the day will be.
