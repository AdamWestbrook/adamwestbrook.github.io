# Welcome
## A quiet place for my words and pictures
#### January 2018

This year marks my tenth as somebody who makes things and publishes them on the internet.

It started out with a [blog](http://adamwestbrook.wordpress.com) and then became [tweets](http://twitter.com/AdamWestbrook) a magazine, [Medium posts](http://medium.com/AdamWestbrook) and, finally, [videos](http://youtube.com/c/delvetv).

All of it has been in the glare of the internet masses or in the pursuit of those masses; all living and dying on the hill of whether random strangers give a shit or not. 

And I'm tired of that. So I've quickly made this a place where I can create in peace.

I'll write here when the mood strikes me: most likely observations about what it's like being creative right now; the problems and solutions I encounter in my work.

You might notice that I've stripped it all back: there's no flashy banner or menu here; you can't like, share or leave a comment. I haven't installed Google Analytics so I can't even tell that you came here. You can plug this into your favourite RSS reader though. 

It's not very pretty but it's small, light, fast and immune to the whims of Silicon Valley shareholders.

If you've arrived directly here, feel free to [take a look around](/).
