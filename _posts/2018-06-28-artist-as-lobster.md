Here's an idea that appeared from nowhere in my morning pages today - fresh off the boat, so to speak.

### Scaffolding

I've spent an inordinate (but predictable) amount of time this week devising complex schedules for myself. 

Predictable because I've just come off the clock on a big 9-month film project and now have a summer of free time ahead of me. 

And I'm determined to use this time to think hard about my direction and where I want to go next as an artist.

But within days I have found myself lost at sea amongst all this freedom.

So the schedule, as strict as it is, is a form of scaffolding - a way of keeping my time structured and vertical while I feel creatively...wobbly.

### A molting lobster

Did you know that a lobster's shell does not grow with the lobster? It's a fixed size which means that when the lobster grows, life becomes very uncomfortable and it has no choice but to ditch its ill-fitting suit.

This process is called Molting and is one of those evolutionary farces that have you wondering how the species even survived this long.

The lobster grows a new soft-shell beneath its old one and, when ready, spends a good half-an-hour on its side on the sea bed, squeezing itself out of its old shell. 

Once free, the lobster's troubles really begin. Their new shell is not fully formed yet - and won't be hard for at least a couple of months. So it must spend that time secluded - either between rocks or inside the abandoned shells of other creatures.

### Growing out of your shell

It's a time of great vulnerability. The thing that made you strong, certain, confident is gone.

You are naked again and just like the lobster, a bit of scaffolding goes a long way to keep you safe and structured.

But, perhaps more significantly, **the shell is gone because you outgrew it**. 

And here endeth the painful metaphor.
