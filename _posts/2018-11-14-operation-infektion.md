It's taken more than a year to get here, but I'm really excited to see a new video series out in the world.

It's called Operation Infektion and it is the result of a great collaboration with talented journalists and filmmakers at *The New York Times*.

Personally, it's a creative and career high for me. It feels like the culmination of the last five years of studying and practicing how to tell good visual stories. 

The story of Russian disinformation is complex and in some places abstract, so it was a real test of my abilities to find a way to show the story as much as tell it. 

Luckily I had some of the best filmmakers at *The New York Times* to help me figure it out, including Adam B Ellick who is the mastermind behind the project; Jonah Kessel who shot all the footage and Leah Varjacques, Andrew Blackwell and Alexandra Garcia who all challenged my ideas and pushed us to make it as good as it could be.

I hope you enjoy watching.
