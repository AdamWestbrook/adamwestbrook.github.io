Pulled directly from my morning pages today:

>> So I'm in a clearing surrounded by trees. It feels like there are multiple paths but they are all overgrown, obscured by weeds and hedges. I've been standing here for a few weeks now. Investigating the potential exits like a nervous bird. A new potential path opened up over the weekend with thoughts of getting a "proper" job. But now a thick fog has rolled in: it surrounds me. I can see barely past my own hands. I can't see the sky or the mountain. I don't even remember what the mountain looks like. And so I am paralysed.

It's worth sharing these moments, when things make so little sense you can only surrender to your lack of understanding.
