I've been making my way through the Netflix series *Abstract* and found myself noting down this line from footwear designer Tinker Hatfield:

>> I think if you just stay in your studio and try and dream up new ideas, it's not a good foundation for your idea. Just get out there and experience life. That gives you a library in your head to then translate that into new design work.

It's pretty vague and bland on its own, but in combination with the episode as a whole and the images which sync this line, it switched a lightbulb on in my head.

I spend too much time sat at my desk on the internet. 

My screen has become a window through which I see and experience the world. Many of my experiences (the library from where I get my ideas) are mediated. 

They are articles recommended in a newsletter, videos supplied by YouTube's algorithm, opinions reverberating through the hollow twittersphere.

No wonder my ideas, my art, feels so...jaundiced.

My screen is my window. A prisoner may have bars over his, but at least the view is real. 

The conclusion of this thinking was a line which is probably as innocuous as Tinker Hatfields:

>> What if I made my life my art?
