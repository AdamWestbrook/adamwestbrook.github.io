title: Throwback Thursday No. 3 - a brief foray into vlogging

Vlogging is a genre of online video that I have steered well clear of for the most part. 

Certainly the way vlogging has developed in recent years requires an energy and a desire to film absolutely everything you live and breathe that I do not possess.

That said, ten years ago I did experiment with the form, so let's take a look.

### Top Ten Predictions for the Future of Journalism (December 2009)

**The context**: So to understand this one you need to picture me at the end of 2009: newly freelance, living in a tiny room in London and - frankly - *terrified*. 

The first six months of freelancing were pretty nausea inducing for me, and I constantly questioned whether I had made the right decision. 

The paid gigs were few and far between.

The only thing I had going for me was a [blog](http://adamwestbrook.wordpress.com) I was writing about the future of journalism. So with the new year, and it's plethora of predictions lists, approaching I decided it would be a good piece of #content. 

**The story**

To do a predictions list wasn't new but I don't remember anyone else doing it in video at the time. 

I had a tiny HD camera - the now defunct Kodak Zi8, which even had an input for an external microphone - and a white wall in my tiny bedroom.

**Looking back**

Yes, I know: *that hair*. Well, all I can say is it hasn't improved that much since. 

As you can probably imagine, I cringe watching this. But this series wouldn't be much good if I only looked at the work I was proud of.

I will say the editing is peppy and at least it is fast-paced. 

It's interesting to see the use of jump cuts in the editing, plus the use of a whiteboard, which would become staples of the YouTube vlogging scene. It was not an original idea in 2009 either.

One thing I don't like: I'm using copyrighted music, something I have made a point of never doing. All I'll say is, it was before the affordable music libraries became available. (But still, no excuse).

**I did it again a year later**:

I enjoyed making this video and it was popular on the blog, so a year later I did a rinse and repeat. 

This turns out to be super handy. Put these two side-by-side and you can see how I have improved and developed in the space of 12 months.

I must have learned motion graphics this year as this new video is full of them. The haircut's a bit better too...
