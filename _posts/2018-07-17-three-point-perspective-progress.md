![Work in progress: three point perspective drawing](/images/wip-perspective.jpg)

Just a quick work in progress to show today: I've been practicing some perspective drawing.

While I've done three-point perspective drawing before on exteriors, I have never done it on interiors. It's tricky. The vanishing points need to be far enough away to avoid everything looking very distorted.

The other challenge is working in Photoshop which - at least on a Mac - does not have an easy way to draw straight lines at an angle.

I think the Windows version has a plugin but it's not available on a Mac. The best solution I've found is to rotate the canvas until the line you want to draw is at 90Ëš and then draw.

I got as far as beginning to ink the outlines - I'll share a finished version once it's done!
