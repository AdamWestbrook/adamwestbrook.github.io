### The flow years

Six years ago I read [this article](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890) by novelist and technologist [Robin Sloan](http://robinsloan.com).

He argued the things we create on the internet can be broken down into two categories: *stock* and *flow*. 

> "Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist. Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time."

At the time I was running a small blog and tweeting near-constantly. 

"Oh no!" I realised "I'm all flow and no stock!"

It was one of those climacteric moments, a peeling away of the blinders. I had spent years reminding people I existed, but produced nothing durable. 

I immediately knew my direction going forward: **make stock**.

### The stock years

So, within weeks I [wrapped up the blog](https://adamwestbrook.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/the-last-post/), said goodbye to 10,000 readers, changed country and directed all my energies into making timeless things.

Since 2012 I have begun to build a library of long-lasting work I am proud of:

- I launched *Inside the Story*, a quarterly magazine storytelling
- I built *delve.tv* a [Webby-nominated YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/delvetv) with 20 short factual video essays
- I wrote and directed [*Parallax*](/parallax) a five-part documentary about life on earth, narrated by aliens
- And then went into a near-year-long process directing an ambitious series for the *New York Times*.

And six years after the first climacteric, I have just had another.

"Oh no! I'm all stock and no flow!"

All stock is not a good thing. I am completely drained of ideas.  I'm spent. I'm a dry tap. 

### It's stock *and* flow, dummy

Yes, the clue was in the title.

As [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2017/11/20/a-few-notes-on-daily-blogging/) points out, you need to be working with both stock and flow, because - done right - one feeds the other.

> "...tweets become blog posts that become book chapters that become books."

So here I am, almost six years to the day, committing to blogging once again. 

But this time, I am blogging for myself and not for other people. The goal is simple and modest: to create and ship one small thing every weekday for as long as I can. It might be the seed of an idea, an observation, a revelation, a glimpse of a bigger work-in-progress; it might sometimes be a comic, a sketch, a photo and just occasionally, a finished video.

The point is not to make something good, but to make something often.

Since 2012 I have never spent less than six weeks creating anything. What will happen when I speed that process up?

My hope: that this modest practice will ease the tap open and the drips will become a waterfall.

### Hello world!

There are a few other differences to my last blog. 

This one is entirely self-hosted, built using Jekyll and written in Markdown. 

And, while my last blog - born in the early days of social media - was connected to every platform going, this one will be positively **anti-social**.

There are no Facebook or Twitter plugins - in fact no plugins at all. You cannot like, dislike, comment, clap or otherwise respond to what I blog. (But you can [email me](/home).)

I have not even installed Google Analytics meaning I will never know if/how many people are reading this. 

You can, however, still plug it into your favourite rss reader. 

Here's to finding a balance between stock and flow!
