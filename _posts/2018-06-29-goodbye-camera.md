One big job this week has been to film a video update for my supporters on [Patreon](http://patreon.com/AdamWestbrook).

So I dug out my faithful Canon 550D, which I bought back in 2010, stuck the even more faithful thrifty-fifty millimetre lens on and started filming.

Three minutes in, the camera died!

It has served me very well over the years, making countless documentaries, video essays, vlogs and more, the world over.

We filmed a [documentary in China together](https://vimeo.com/33482078), [musicians in Siberia](https://vimeo.com/16963218),  interviewed [killers-turned-lawyers](https://vimeo.com/7742500), [crushed cars](https://vimeo.com/15716129) and enough corporate films to fill a swimming pool. 

I know it's only an object, but you can't help but feel a slight twinge of sadness for something you've worked so closely with over the years.

Since 2015 my work has moved more towards post-production; I definitely consider myself an editor more than a shooter these days.

The last things we filmed together were standups for a video series for the tech publication [*The Memo*](http://thememo.com) (now defunct itself!)

The update for my patrons, meanwhile, was done the old fashioned way.
