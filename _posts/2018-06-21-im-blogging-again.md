Hello world!

So here is a test blog post about where I talk about why I have gotten back to blogging and how that all feels. 

I'm going to upload it with a [link like this one](http://adamwestbrook.co.uk) which should link back to the home page.

Ok cool!

### But what about an unordered list?
  
Well, that should come out easily.

- Just start with this

- then you're done!

### And ordered lists?

1. Is a one
2. Is a two
3. Etc

Right, let's try this out.
