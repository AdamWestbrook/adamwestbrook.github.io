# Press

Sometimes my work brings me a bit of publicity and the opportunity to talk to some really interesting people about art, storytelling and filmmaking. 

**Here's a selection of press from over the years**.

I tell Nathalie from the [Mentorless Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/mentorless/adam-westbrook-and-the-art-of-storytelling-on-the-internet-mentorless-podcast-episode-1) about being creative when nobody's watching (2018)

I'm featured in an article about how to make money from YouTube on the [official Patreon blog](https://blog.patreon.com/make-money-youtube-2017) (2017)

Popularity and quality are not the same thing! I explain my theory to [Alex Cespedes of the Project Book Podcast](https://alexcespedes.com/2017/04/adam-westbrook-quality-popularity/). (2017)

I tell Ron Dawson of [Radio Film School](http://daredreamer.com/rfs-adamwestbrook/) my ideas about storytelling and how I make video essays (2016)

I talk about creativity and storytelling on [Chris Oatley's ArtCast](https://chrisoatley.com/delve1/) (2014)

I talk about how to make information interesting to Tina Remiz of [BAMM](https://bammglobal.com/conversation-adam-westbrook/) (2014)
