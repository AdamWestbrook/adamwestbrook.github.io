# Biography

I am an independent video artist, currently based in London.

I weave words and pictures together to make visual stories, sometimes just for fun and sometimes in collaboration with other people.

A lot of my work involves taking complex ideas and constructing a narrative that uses the principles of film form to tell a fascinating, emotional and visual story.

I love experimenting with the potential of visual storytelling, whether by [telling a story backwards](https://vimeo.com/105681474), creating a [fictional narrator](/parallax) or pushing the boundaries of [metaphor and semiotics](https://vimeo.com/157044515).

Between 2013-2016 I made [short video essays](/portfolio) which have been watched millions of times.

In the past I've written, directed or edited films for *The New York Times*, *Shopify* and *HuffPost UK*.
