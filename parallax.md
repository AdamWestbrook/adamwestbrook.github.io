# Parallax
## An experimental web series (2017)

Nearly 40 years ago, Carl Sagan imagined an _Encyclopaedia Galactica_, a “vast repository of the knowledge of many worlds”. 

“Imagine” he pondered, “the impact on us if we could study a rich compilation of not merely one world but billions.” 

_Parallax_ is a series of video essays that wonders what this Encyclopaedia Galactica might look like. What do we learn when we step outside of our myopic, planetary view and see life from a wider perspective? 

_Parallax_ is an ambitious experiment in visual storytelling. 

It takes the video essay genre and smashes it with science-fiction, using video in the public domain in a unique and creative way. I wanted to see what would happen if I screwed with the conventions of the documentary/video essay and used a fictional narrator. 

I worked with actor, [Jennifer Munby](http://jennifermunby.com), to create a voice for the alien narrator that oozes timeless wisdom. 

The series has an [original score](https://open.spotify.com/user/adamwestbrook/playlist/3uuSI1dlmO0XKjGRrfLjZl), composed by [Dale Nichols](http://dalenicholsmusic.com) that evokes the TV series Cosmos.
