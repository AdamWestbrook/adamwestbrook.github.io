# Hello, I'm Adam.

I'm a video artist trying hard to be good at telling visual stories.

I've just wrapped on directing a major new series for *The New York Times*, due for release in autumn/fall 2018.

You can [get to know me](/story), [see my body of work so far](/portfolio) and [find out how to support me](/support).

Or you can [email](mailto:adam@adamwestbrook.co.uk) me.

Oh, and I've just started [blogging](/blog) again!
