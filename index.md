# Hello, I'm Adam.

I'm an Emmy-nominated filmmaker in London, trying hard to be good at telling visual stories.

Among other things, I write and direct short factual films for *The New York Times* including [Jaron Lanier Fixes The Internet](https://nytimes.com/datadignity) and [Operation Infektion](http://www.adamwestbrook.co.uk/operation-infektion/), a major three-part series about Russian disinformation, which was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 2019.

You can [get to know me](/story), [see my body of work so far](/films) and [find out how to support me](/support).

Oh, and I've just started [a new weekly newsletter](http://adamwestbrook.substack.com)!
