# Hello, I'm Adam.

I'm an artist, journalist and Emmy-nominated filmmaker. 

Many of my films have appeared in *The New York Times* including [The Fauci Awards!](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/fauci-public-health-awards.html), [Jaron Lanier Fixes The Internet](https://nytimes.com/datadignity) and [Operation Infektion](http://www.adamwestbrook.co.uk/operation-infektion/), a major three-part series, which was nominated for two Emmy Awards.

You can [get to know me](/story), [see my body of work so far](/films) and [find out how to support me](/support).

Oh, and I write [a newsletter](http://adamwestbrook.substack.com) about the creative life and telling visual stories.
