# Hello, I'm Adam.

I'm a video artist trying hard to be good at telling visual stories.

Most recently, I co-wrote and directed [Operation Infektion](http://www.adamwestbrook.co.uk/operation-infektion/) a major three-part series about Russian disinformation and fake news, with *The New York Times*.

You can [get to know me](/story), [see my body of work so far](/portfolio) and [find out how to support me](/support).

Or you can [email](mailto:adam@adamwestbrook.co.uk) me.

Oh, and I've just started [blogging](/blog) again!
